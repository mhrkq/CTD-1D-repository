Team A – Ai Stead Mai Date/Outing Ideas App

Scenario. Running out of date ideas? Fear not! Introducing Ai Stead Mai – By compiling the best things to do all over Singapore (including our food recommendations!) with filters, Ai Stead Mai was created for youths and adults of any age looking for things to do in Singapore. On many occasions, young adults struggle to find the perfect group activity or date and require a lot of time and planning just to enjoy a day out. Ai Stead Mai suggests the perfect date or outing based on the specific filters required by the user, saving precious time and removing the stress factor that can impact what is meant to be relaxing or fun. 

Description. The app prompts the user with a Tkinter interface with buttons as filters for them to narrow down the options to suit their needs better. For example, if a group of 3 friends are in the East would like to find something to do in the price range of “$$” (a 2-digit figure), the filters narrow the options down to things to do in the East for “$$” for a group of 3. Ai Stead Mai’s filters and features include a randomizer feature, filter by occasion, location, time range for activity and price. The app currently has over 70 suggested food or activity places. Additionally, clicking on the suggested activity will direct the user to Google. This is useful as Google itself does not have a filtered search function.
